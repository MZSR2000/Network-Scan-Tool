# Network-Scan-Tool
1. Discovers devices connected to your local network (LAN) using ping commands. 
2. Scans open ports on remote hosts 

 Instructions:
1. Discover Local Network Devices:
 - Use the 'ping' command to check each IP in a specified subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.x) for
connectivity.
 - For each reachable device, print its IP address.
2. Port Scanning on Remote Hosts:
 - Implement a port scanning function that scans a set of ports on a remote host.
 - The script should have options such as scanning all ports or specific ports.
3. Script Behavior:
 - The user should be able to choose between discovering local network devices or
scanning open ports on a remote host.
